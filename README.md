Objective:

The parking system is in development for a long time, until now most of the shopping malls have the parking slot status display through Ultrasonic for car presence and light for indication. It is not enough for smartness, For the smart parking system, everything should be turned into autonomous like auto-detection of money, slots availability etc.

Smart Parking system helps to create database for visitors and it has authentication as well as auto detection of fee based on parking time



1.    Auto billing shopping cart   trolley with QR code scanner

 

Objective:

Shopping is easy but waiting on a bill counter after shopping is too booring and tedious task. Huge amount of rush plus plus cashier preparing the bill with barcode scanner is too time consuming and results in long ques. So here we have made an innovative idea which will be placed in the shopping trolley itself.

1.     Digital Drawing (Gesture Recognition) using OpenCV, Python

(gesture to speech conversion)

 

Gesture Recognition is a technology which is used to identify human gestures with the help of mathematical algorithms. Gesture recognition recognizes the hand, tracks the hand movements & also provides information about hand position orientation and flux of the fingers. The colour markers are placed at the tip of the user fingers. This helps the webcam to identify the movement of hand and the gesture recognition. The drawing application allows the user you to draw on any surface by tracking the fingertip movements of the user’s index finger
 

2.      IoT based Smart Energy Meter using NodeMCU ESP8266.

(various rooms we need to monitor  and Ai for prediction)

 

Objective:

Conventional energy meter which we use in our households to measure Energy consumption is an offline device, so it has to be monitored manually. But nowadays there are Smart Energy Meters available in the market whose readings can be monitored from anywhere using the internet and not only energy consumption but we can monitor multiple parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, frequency, etc. on laptop or mobile using IoT

 
3.    IoT Based Restaurant Menu Ordering System
IoT based food ordering systems are replacing the traditional food ordering system in restaurants. Instead of using paper-based menu cards, Restaurants are now installing touch screen displays on tables, so the customers can directly select the food items from the screen and order the food easily.we are building an IoT based smart restaurant project using Arduino. Here a TFT touch display is used to make the order and the HC-05 Bluetooth module is used to send the data to Arduino. Blynk app is used as an IoT platform where all the data is uploaded and can be monitored from anywhere in the world

 

 

 4.    Smart CCTV Surveillance System using Raspberry Pi With Motion Eye OS

 

 

CCTV cameras are very common now days and they are good tool to monitor and surveillance the home or office for any mishappenings. But still IP cameras, which provide video feed accessible from anywhere, are costlier. So here is one cheaper solution using Raspberry Pi- How about setting up a cheaper Raspberry Pi security camera system? This can be done easily and you don’t have to spend too much…

 

In this project, we will be using Motion eye OS; an open source operating system available for Raspberry Pi to convert it to a smart surveillance system. It supports multiple system on board devices similar to Raspberry Pi (Banana PI, Orange PI One etc.). It comes with advanced features like fast network video streaming, motion detection and notification, integration with dropbox and Google drive, uploading videos and imsages to the cloud and many more

 

 

 

 

 

 
5.    IoT based Smart Wi-Fi doorbell using Raspberry Pi and Pi- Camera

 

Security is major concern nowadays and today we have all types of surveillance and security system available in the market. But they are very expensive and sometimes create problems which we can’t solve. Previously we built a surveillance camera which can stream live video on IoT cloud and today we will build a low cost Raspberry Pi based Smart Wi-Fi doorbell. This system will send the picture of visitor on email when the door bell switch is pressed. A PiCamera is attached with raspberry pi to take the picture, although a USB webcam can also be used if you don’t have PiCamera. This system can be installed at the main door of your home or office and can be monitored from anywhere in the world over internet
